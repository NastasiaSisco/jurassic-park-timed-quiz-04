## Info

Test your Jurassic Park knowledge!

My first attempt at a JavaScript/CSS app from scratch. Homework for Bootcamp. No starter code.

### How-To

Upon page load: the welcome screen's element is shown, hiding the quiz screen's element

There is a start button which reveals the quiz screen whilst hiding the welcome page

Questions will appear on page. Select your choice with a click then click submit button to evaluate if answer was correct or incorrect.

### Stay Tuned/More to Come

* More questions to come with functioning Next button
* Countdown timer to be created
* If a question is answered incorrectly, and additional 10 seconds will be deducted from timer.
* If timer runs out, a loss is recorded.
* If quiz is completed within time limit, score is calculated and a prompt will appear so user can add initials to "leader board" which is saved to localStorage and retrieved later.
